                                    Jump Height increments,
                                    and new levels!
                                    Additionally, it uses

                                    This game is far better than my last!
                                    It uses modular frameworks and has barely
                                    any free models. I coded everything myself and made the 
                                    abilities! The UI you see was also made by me and 
                                    is way better than my first game!

                                    Lastly, this was my best game yet! It is way 
                                    less laggy and is built performance wise! It is completely
                                    built upon modular frameworks and it optimizes the best performance! 
                                    Additionally, the UI looks even better as well as the builds. It incorporates
                                    pets, stock markets, and new islands!
